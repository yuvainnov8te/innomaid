She wants to work as domestic helper in Singapore to earn money to support for her child. While away for 2 years, her mother will take care of her child.<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p style=\\\"font-size: medium; line-height: normal;\\\"> <\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p style=\\\"font-size: medium; line-height: normal;\\\"><strong>Personality<\\/strong><\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p style=\\\"font-size: medium; line-height: normal;\\\">She is someone who is hardworking. She is young, cheerful and a Christian and she is able to handle pork.<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p style=\\\"font-size: medium; line-height: normal;\\\"> <\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p style=\\\"font-size: medium; line-height: normal;\\\"><strong>Experience<\\/strong><\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p style=\\\"font-size: medium; line-height: normal;\\\">Tirsa works in Singapore for 5 months as a domestic helper. She did cooking, car washing, house cleaning, laundry and prepare kids to school. There were 6 members in the house with 4 bedrooms. She did not finish her contract because she was given too much work and she has no enough time to rest. Her agent talked to her employer, she was returned to Indonesia.<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p style=\\\"font-size: medium; line-height: normal;\\\">She also works in Indonesia for 2 years taking care of a week old baby until she turned 2 years old. Aside from that she was also required to do cleaning and cooking.<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p style=\\\"font-size: medium; line-height: normal;\\\"> <\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p style=\\\"font-size: medium; line-height: normal;\\\"><strong>Cooking<\\/strong><\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p style=\\\"font-size: medium; line-height: normal;\\\">She could cook Chinese and Indonesian dishes. She loves to chicken curry, stir fried vegetables, steam fish and soup.<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p style=\\\"font-size: medium; line-height: normal;\\\"> <\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p style=\\\"font-size: medium; line-height: normal;\\\"><strong>Children<\\/strong><\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p style=\\\"font-size: medium; line-height: normal;\\\">As a mother, she took care of her own child and going back to Singapore, she expresses that she would like to take care of children even infant.<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p style=\\\"font-size: medium; line-height: normal;\\\"> <\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p style=\\\"font-size: medium; line-height: normal;\\\"><strong>Hand phone<\\/strong><\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p style=\\\"font-size: medium; line-height: normal;\\\">She is comfortable that her employer will keep her hand phone during working hours so that she can focus on her work.  She will follow the employer&#39;s instruction regarding hand phone usage.<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p style=\\\"font-size: medium; line-height: normal;\\\"> <\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p style=\\\"font-size: medium; line-height: normal;\\\"><strong>2 years contract<\\/strong><\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p style=\\\"font-size: medium; line-height: normal;\\\">She is aware that she will enter into 2 years contract with her future employer and she is committed to finish.<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p style=\\\"font-size: medium; line-height: normal;\\\"> <\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p style=\\\"font-size: medium; line-height: normal;\\\"><strong>Recommendation<\\/strong><\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p style=\\\"font-size: medium; line-height: normal;\\\">I could see that she is someone who is teachable and would be willing to learn.

She is applying to work in Singapore as a domestic helper. While away for 2 years, her mother will be responsible to take care of her children.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPersonality\\r\\n\\r\\nShe describes herself as humble, patient and will follow the instruction of her employer. She loves reading of magazines and does cleaning when she has free time.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nExperience\\r\\n\\r\\nShe works as a helper in Singapore for a total of 4 years. In her 1st employer, she works in a big house; 3 storey house, 5 bedrooms and 5 bathrooms. She was in charge of cleaning the house, do gardening and take care of dog. She also washes the car 3 times per week and sometimes she cooks.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn her 2nd employer, she and her employer agreed that she will only work for a year because her passport will expires after a year. Her main responsibilities were cleaning and cooking. She also looks after the 2 kids ages 12 and 15. She also cooks for her employer.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCooking\\r\\n\\r\\nWorking in Singapore for 4 years, she learns some of the basic Chinese dishes.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChild care\\r\\n\\r\\nShe is comfortable she could manage to take care of children and infants not just because of her past experience but because she is also a mother who takes care of her children since they were born.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPet care\\r\\n\\r\\nShe has past experience taking care of pet and she was able to manage that.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHand phone\\r\\n\\r\\nShe is comfortable that her employer will keep her hand phone during working hours so that she can focus on her work.  She will follow the employer\'s instruction regarding hand phone usage.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n2 years contract\\r\\n\\r\\nShe is aware that she will enter into 2 years contract with her future employer and she is committed to finish.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nRecommendation\\r\\n\\r\\nI could see that based on her personality, she doesn\'t talk a lot but I could see her honesty and sincerity that she is willing and determine to do her job well. I could see that she talks less but work hard. I could see that she has no problem following instructions. She works in Singapore for a total of 4 years already and I believe that her adjustment to a new environment would just be minimal. I hope that you give her a chance to work with you. Please view her profile and consider her then.\\r\\n\",\n    \"users_agents_id\": \"53\",\n    \"users_agents_company_name\": \"\",\n    \"created_at\": \"2016-02-04 01:53:35\",\n    \"updated_at\": \"2016-02-04 06:53:35\",\n    \"deleted\": \"N\",\n    \"profile_image\": \"99761.jpg\",\n    \"availability\": \"Available\",\n    \"expected_salary\": \"0.00\",\n    \"passport_number\": \"\",\n    \"work_permit_no\": \"\",\n    \"video_link\": \"https:\\/\\/youtu.be\\/kjRuJroe-9s\"\n}','2016-02-15 07:10:50','2016-02-15 12:09:31',0);

She has 12 siblings and she is the youngest. She wants to work in Singapore for her family especially for her son\'s education. While away for 2 years, her mother and husband will take care of her child.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPersonality\r\n\r\nShe describes herself as hardworking and good mother to her son, honest, simple and flexible. When she has free time, she loves to cook. For her a good helper is loyal and could follow the instruction, fast learner and honest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExperience\r\n\r\nShe works as a house helper for about 2 years where she works in the morning and study at night. She did that during her college days. She was responsible in cleaning the house, washing laundry and watch over the kids also.\r\n\r\nAs a mother, she took care of her own children since they were born. And as a housewife, she does cooking, laundry and house cleaning.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCooking\r\n\r\nShe loves to cook and as a mother and a housewife she prepares meals for her family. She is also willing to learn how to cook Chinese dishes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChildcare\r\n\r\nShe is willing to take care of children and infants and will treat them like her own.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHand phone\r\n\r\nShe is comfortable that her employer will keep her hand phone during working hours so that she can focus on her work.  She will follow the employer\'s instruction regarding hand phone usage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2 years contract\r\n\r\nShe is aware that she will enter into 2 years contract with her future employer and she is committed to finish.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRecommendation\r\n\r\nI could see that her own experience is being a mother and housewife who takes care of her child and prepare meals for her family.

She loves reading of magazines and does cleaning when she has free time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExperience\r\n\r\nShe works as a helper in Singapore for a total of 4 years. In her 1st employer, she works in a big house; 3 storey house, 5 bedrooms and 5 bathrooms. She was in charge of cleaning the house, do gardening and take care of dog. She also washes the car 3 times per week and sometimes she cooks.\r\n\r\nIn her 2nd employer, she and her employer agreed that she will only work for a year because her passport will expires after a year. Her main responsibilities were cleaning and cooking. She also looks after the 2 kids ages 12 and 15. She also cooks for her employer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCooking\r\n\r\nWorking in Singapore for 4 years, she learns some of the basic Chinese dishes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChild care\r\n\r\nShe is comfortable she could manage to take care of children and infants not just because of her past experience but because she is also a mother who takes care of her children since they were born.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPet care\r\n\r\nShe has past experience taking care of pet and she was able to manage that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHand phone\r\n\r\nShe is comfortable that her employer will keep her hand phone during working hours so that she can focus on her work.

I could see that she talks less but work hard. I could see that she has no problem following instructions.

However, after she was transferred to 2nd employer, she worked a total of 1 year and 6 months. They lived in a condo with 2 bedrooms. There were 5 in the family. She did housework and cooking. She also did grocery with her employer. She was not able to finish her contract because her husband had an accident and she need to return back.

She did cooking, car washing, house cleaning, laundry and prepare kids to school. There were 6 members in the house with 4 bedrooms. She did not finish her contract because she was given too much work and she has no enough time to rest. Her agent talked to her employer, she was returned to Indonesia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"font-size: medium; line-height: normal;\">She also works in Indonesia for 2 years taking care of a week old baby until she turned 2 years old.
